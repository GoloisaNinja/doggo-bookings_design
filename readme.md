# Vanilla Design Project for Go Bookings

Created this project and repo:

- easier to work on HTML and SCSS outside of Goland
- refresher on working with vanilla JS
- refresher on live server enviroment

Once the primary styles and base HTML have been created here, I should be able to easily import them into Goland. Then I will then update the [go-bookings repo](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/go-bookings) and begin the integration of backend Go data into my fully formed templates with SCSS/css.
